# ESP32S3_DEV_Minimal_LowPower

This project implements a **minimal low-power development board** based on the **ESP32-S3**.  
The design focuses on reducing component count, board complexity, and idle power consumption, while still exposing the full capabilities of the ESP32-S3 for advanced development.  

Unlike traditional development boards, this design does **not include a USB-to-UART bridge**. Instead, it leverages the **native USB interface** of the ESP32-S3 for programming and communication, resulting in a simpler and more efficient design.

## üß™ Demo Application

Included with this project is a **human presence detection demo** based on Wi-Fi spectral footprint analysis:  

- Scans available Wi-Fi networks, collecting **SSID** and **RSSI** values.  
- Applies a **probability-based algorithm** using **normal distribution** to estimate environmental changes.  
- Detects human presence based on variations in the Wi-Fi spectrum.  
- Displays results on a **color IPS display**.  

This demonstrates the potential of the ESP32-S3 in **low-cost sensing and AIoT applications** without requiring dedicated motion sensors.
